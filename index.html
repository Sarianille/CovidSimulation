        <h1>Interactive COVID-19 Simulation</h1>
        <p>
          This simulation is not meant to be a realistic representation of the spread of COVID-19,
          but a simplified model meant to encourage critical thinking. Feel free to experiment with
          the parameters and see how they affect the spread of the virus.
        </p>

        <h3>Quick guide</h6>
        <p>
          Node count - number of people in the simulation. If the slider is set to 0, a random
          number of nodes will be generated.<br>
          Infected percentage - how many people are infected at the start of the simulation.<br>
          Virus aggressiveness - base of how likely the virus is to spread from one person to another.<br>
          Restrictions - different measures that affect the spread of the virus. Hover over them to get
          a basic idea of their effect.<br>
          Scenarios - predefined sets of restrictions and virus aggressivity that might be interesting to
          compare.<br>
          Start/Stop - start and stop the simulation.<br>
