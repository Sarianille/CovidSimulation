# Running the Simulation

You need to have Node.js installed. If you don't have it installed,
you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

1. Package installation:
- Open a terminal in the project directory.
- Run `npm install`.

2. Running the simulation:
- Run `npx vite`.

3. Accessing the simulation:
- Open a browser and go to the link provided by Vite.

# Using the Simulation

The simulation has an intuitive user interface.

You can customize the simulation by changing the parameters. Your options include: the number of nodes, the initial number of infected nodes, the aggressiveness of the virus, and several restrictions. You can also drag the nodes around for a more interactive experience and better visibility.

You can choose from predefined scenarios or create your own. The changes you make will be reflected in the simulation.

You start the simulation by clicking the "Start" button. You can pause and resume the simulation at any time. The simulation will stop when there are no more nodes to infect.

You can view the spreading of the virus in real-time. The nodes will change color to indicate their status. You can also view the number of newly infected nodes in the chart below the simulation graph. The chart will update frequently.
